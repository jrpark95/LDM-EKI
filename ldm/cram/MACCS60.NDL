!     Input for RCAP
!     Prepared by N.I.Tak (2017/12/xx)
!     Modified by S.Y.Kim (2018/09/xx)
!     The same data with MACCS 60 nuclides 
!     core_inventory is not revised and meaningless yet for LWR

!     ---------------------
!     reference of database
!     ---------------------
!     half life      : INDEXR.DAT of MACCS
!     atomic weight  : EPA website
!     chemical group : Sample Problem A (NUREG/CR-6613)
!     core inventory : 
!     decay chain    : EPA website, Sample Problem A
!     recommend to sort atomic mass number
!     differences between SOARCA and Sample Problem A are
!     (1) list of pseudo-stable nuclides:
!     Rb-88, Y-91m, Nb-97, Nb-97m, Rh-103m, Rh-106, Te-131, Xe-135m, Ba-137m, Pr-144, Pr-144m
!     above radionuclides are pseudo-stable in Sample Problem A as they are implicitly included in a dose calculation of their parent 
!     (2) chemical group of radionuclides

!     --------------------
!     nuclide 042 : Cs-137
